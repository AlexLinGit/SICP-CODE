# SICP-CODE
SICP practice problem code from the online textbook "Structures and Interpretations of Computer Programs" as suggested by some online sources.

Not all of the problems and chapters have been, read, yet these are the problems which have been solved and just now (November 1st) been transfered onto this repository.

Most of the problems were solved throuhgout the last year in spare time.  I have no previous coding experience, so it is my best attempt at the answers.

Most of these were accomplished on the interpreter Racket, and some on Geany. 


Similarly, other small programs I wrote for the fun of it.  


Enjoy!
